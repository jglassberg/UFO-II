# UFO-II

Overview of the Analysis
Dana is looking to provide in-depth analysis of UFO sightings through filtering options for the following criteria:
  -Date
  -City
  -State
  -Country
  -Shape
  
 Results
  A search can be performed using the left fillable fields. Although the fields are not required, the search can be reduced by adding keywords to each filter search under: (1) enter date; (2) city; (3) state; (4) country; and (5) shape. For example, enter the applicable date you want to capture, plus a city that had reported UFO sighting. This move will allow you to capture only specified sightings in locations. The more fields that are added, the more granual the search. 
  
Summary

Drawback
One drawback is not being able to filter multiple cities, states or even a date range for larger populations. Comparative data will have to be pulled seperately rather than in an aggregated report for manipulation. 

Recommendations
1. To add a date range for comparative analysis over a given period of time.
2. A drop down for comment submissions that syncronize cleaner and more concise entries to see if there are any themes present in the sightings.
